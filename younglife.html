    <h3>
        Young Life is a ministry that starts with adults who are concerned enough about kids to go to them, on their turf and in their culture, building bridges of authentic friendship.
        We listen to their stories and learn what's important to them because we genuinely care about their joys, triumphs, heartaches and setbacks.
        Because their Young Life leader believes in them, they begin to see that their lives have great worth, meaning and purpose.

        I have been a Young Life leader at Louisville Middle School since 2014.
        I volunteer in the school twice a week to help students with schoolwork.
        I mentor students and run bi-weekly events for around 25 kids.
