    <h3>
        Young Life is a ministry that starts with adults who are concerned enough about kids to go to them, on their turf and in their culture, building bridges of authentic friendship.
        We listen to their stories and learn what's important to them because we genuinely care about their joys, triumphs, heartaches and setbacks.
        Because their Young Life leader believes in them, they begin to see that their lives have great worth, meaning, and purpose.

        I was a Young Life leader at Louisville Middle School from 2014 - 2017.
        I volunteered in the school twice a week to help students with schoolwork.
        I mentored students and ran bi-weekly events for around 25 kids.
